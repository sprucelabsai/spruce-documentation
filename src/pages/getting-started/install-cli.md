# Install the SpruceCLI

This is the fastest way to get up and running with the Spruce CLI. It's the best way to get started in writing regression proof node modules.

## Installing using Homebrew (WIP)

This does not work... yet. I could use some help here. If anyone is interested, [reach out to us on X](https://x.com/sprucebot). For now, you have to follow the steps under "Installing manually".

```bash
brew tap sprucelabsai-community/spruce-cli
brew install spruce-cli
```

## Installing manually

1. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">latest LTS Node</a>.
5. Quit vscode (**very important or vscode won't get new settings**)

### Install Yarn

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Install Spruce CLI

Once Node, Yarn, and vscode are ready, run the following: ðŸ‘‡

```bash
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
```
