In Spruce, your views are rendered on the edge, while your Skill is hosted on a server. So, you have to use the [Mercury event system](../../concepts/mercury/) to communicate between the two. Mercury also allows you to pass information other skills.

```typescript

// inside of Skill View sending message to the Skill with the namespace "eightbitstories"

const client = await this.connectToApi()
await this.client.emitAndFlattenResponses(
  'eightbitstories.submit-feedback::v2023_09_05',
  {
    payload: {
      feedback: 'Help make this better!',
    },
  }
)

```
