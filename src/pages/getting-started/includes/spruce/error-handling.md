Spruce provides a much more robust, standardized error handling system. You can use the [SpruceError](../../concepts/errors/) class to create custom errors, you define the Schemas for those errors to give them shape, and then use try-catch blocks to handle them.

```shell
spruce create.error
```

This will create an error builder inside of your skill at `./src/errors/{{errorName}}.builder.ts`. Inside there is the schema that defines your error.

You can throw an error you have defined like this:

```typescript
throw new SpruceError({
  code: 'MY_ERRORS_NAME_HERE',
  friendlyMessage: 'All errors can provide a friendly error message!',
})
```
