[Heartwood](../../concepts/views/) handles the rendering of all front end components. It adopts the philosphy of "Everything Beautiful". While you are constrained to the views that Heartwood provides, you can customize their look by running the following in your skill:

```shell
spruce create.theme
```

This will create a `skill.theme.ts` file you can customize. If you want to apply a theme to your organization (vs just your skill), you can utilize the [Theme Skill](https://spruce.bot/#views/theme.root).
