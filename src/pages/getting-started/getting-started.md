Before you start working with Spruce, it's important to get a feel for how it's different from the programming language or system you're used to. 

In this guide, we'll walk you through what makes Spruce unique compared to other development frameworks. You'll discover how Spruce handles various parts of building an app and find out what you need to know to begin. We've designed this transition section to make your first step into Spruce development as smooth as possible.

## Pre-requisites
Before transitioning to Spruce, you should:
- Have a basic understanding of TypeScript, as this is the core language used in Spruce development.
- Be familiar with full-stack development concepts, including front-end and back-end development processes.
