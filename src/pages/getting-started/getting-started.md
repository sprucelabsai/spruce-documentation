React developers are used to creating components for their UI, managing state internally or with state management libraries like Redux. In Spruce, while the concept of components remains, it is extended with "Skills" that include both front-end and back-end logic, all within TypeScript's statically-typed environment.

### Data Persistence

In React, data is often fetched from an API and stored within component state or global state. Spruce introduces "Stores," which manage data persistence in a more integrated way, connecting directly to the backend and providing a seamless data management experience.

### Event Handling

React apps typically handle user interactions and component communication through a combination of state and props. Spruce uses a centralized event system, allowing for more complex and scalable interactions across the full-stack application.

### API Integration

Making API calls in React usually involves the Fetch API or libraries like Axios. Spruce also relies on API calls for server-client communication, but these are handled through Spruce's backend services and the Mercury Client for real-time capabilities.

### Error Handling

React has mechanisms like error boundaries to handle errors gracefully. Spruce uses try-catch blocks to manage errors, which is a familiar pattern for JavaScript developers but applied across both client and server sides.

### Testing

Testing in React is often done with tools like Jest and the React Testing Library. Spruce uses similar tools, such as Jest, but the testing scope is expanded to include backend services in addition to front-end components.

### User Authentication and Management

Authentication in React might use context for state management or libraries like Auth0 for handling user authentication. Spruce employs a token-based authentication system, a common approach for full-stack applications that manage user sessions and security across both server and client.
