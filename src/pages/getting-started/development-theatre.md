# Install Development Theatre ⚔️

A `Theatre` is a fully functioning `Spruce Platform`. It includes all the tools you need to build, test, and run your Spruce applications.

Open up your favorite terminal app and run the following command to install Development Theatre.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprucelabsai-community/theatre-monorepo/master/support/install.sh)"
```
> **Note**: This approach only supports M Series Macs (for now). If you're not on an M Series Mac, you can [install the theatre manually](../manual-install).

## Now What?
