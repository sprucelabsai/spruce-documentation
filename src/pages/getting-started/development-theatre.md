# Install Development Theatre ⚔️

Open up your favorite terminal app and run the following command to install Development Theatre.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprucelabsai-community/theatre-monorepo/master/support/install.sh)"
```
> **Note**: This approach only supports M Series Macs (for now). If you're not on an M Series Mac, you can install the Spruce CLI directly 👇.

## Install the Spruce CLI Directly (if above doesn't work)

If you don't have an M Series Mac, or if you want to install the directly Spruce CLI (without the development theatre), you can follow these steps:

1. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">latest LTS Node</a>.
2. Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">Yarn 1</a>.
3. Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code (vscode)</a>.
4. Setup <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">vscode to work through command line</a>.
5. Quit vscode (**very important or vscode won't get new settings**)

Once Node, Yarn, and vscode are ready, run the following: 👇

```bash
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
```

## Now What?
