# KatasðŸ¥‹

There are two paths you can take to hone your skills:

1. **Node Module**: Set yourself up with an empty node module and start writing tests. This best for when you want to master TDD seperate from the Spruce Platform.
2. **Spruce Kata**: You can follow one of our Spruce katas to learn the ins and outs of the Spruce Platform. This is for when you have the basics of TDD and are ready to learn the Spruce Platform.

## Node Module

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Create your project</strong></summary>


If you want to write a node module from scratch than anyone can use, you can start by running the following command:

```bash
cd path/to/your/projects
spruce create.module kata1
```

> **Note**: Make sure to follow the instructions in the CLI from this point forward.

> **Note**: Along the way, you will be asked if you want to install the "Skill" feature. You can select "Always Skip".

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Create your first test</strong></summary>

Once you are in your new module, you can open up terminal and run:

```bash
spruce create.test
```

> **Note**: You will be asked if you are making a "Behavioral" or "Implementation" test. You can select "Behavioral" for now.

> **Note**: You will be asked which abstract test to extend, select `AbstractSpruceTest`.
