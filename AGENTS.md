## Working with Codex on Documentation

Use this as a lightweight collaboration guide when drafting docs together.

### What to share up front
- Goal and audience: who it's for, what they need to do, and what "done" means.
- Constraints and sources: key files, style guides, and must-keep wording.
- Scope: one page/section or one decision at a time for faster iteration.
- Feedback: specific notes on tone, accuracy, and depth so revisions are focused.
- Checkpoints: draft, review, and polish in passes to keep changes clean.
- Package references: always use full package names and wrap them in `backticks`.

### Suggested flow
1) Align on goals and audience.
2) Identify sources, constraints, and gaps.
3) Draft in small slices.
4) Review and refine with targeted feedback.
